## Quickstart

### Frontend Dev Server

* `yarn dev` to server on localhost:3000
* `yarn ts:watch` in a visible pane to monitor Typescript errors (the [NextJS dev server does not do this](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/14997))


### Format

* `yarn lint` to check
* `yarn format` to autofix as much as possible
